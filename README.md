Shell scripting to learn git commands


I have demonstrated a strong intermediate level of skill maturity through practical software development, cloud deployment, and process automation.

I developed Python-based applications to improve team operations by automating manual tasks, streamlining team updates, managing on-call details, accessing SharePoint links easily, maintaining call-out trackers, and enabling faster work management for shift leads and team members. I also created an app that automatically opens essential tools and client environments, significantly reducing setup time for team members.

Additionally, I have improved workflow productivity by identifying and implementing a ServiceNow extension that allows faster entry of work notes using shortcuts.

In cloud technologies, I have gained strong hands-on experience with AWS infrastructure by building secure and optimized environments. This includes setting up VPCs, subnets, route tables, and configuring internet and NAT gateways to allow private subnet instances to safely access external resources.

I have worked on VPC endpoint gateways to securely access S3 buckets without exposing credentials or relying on NAT gateways, helping to reduce cloud costs and improve security. I have deployed applications across multiple subnets with Application Load Balancers to ensure high availability and zero downtime. I also configured AWS WAF firewall services to enforce traffic control, blocking unauthorized access and applying necessary security rules.

Overall, I have shown strong intermediate proficiency in Python development, cloud networking, cloud security, automation, and cost optimization. I continue to build on these foundations and am actively moving toward an advanced skill level by applying real-world solutions and learning more advanced cloud and development practices.


I have demonstrated strong intermediate leadership maturity by taking initiative to identify and solve team challenges through practical software development and process optimization. I developed Python-based applications that not only improved team operations but also empowered team members to work more efficiently by automating manual tasks and streamlining workflows. My leadership was evident in how I improved team collaboration and communication by simplifying task tracking, managing on-call details, and automating report generation.

I took ownership of improving our workflow further by creating a solution that automatically launches essential tools and resources for team members, cutting down on setup time. Additionally, I introduced a ServiceNow extension that significantly increased productivity by streamlining the process of entering work notes using shortcuts, showing my ability to identify and implement impactful tools for the team.
