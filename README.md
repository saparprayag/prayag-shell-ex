Shell scripting to learn git commands


Developed an app using python for shift leads and team members which increased efficiency and quality
 Shift lead app:
Team Updates Simplified: Quickly take updates for the 3A and 3B teams without the hassle of maintaining separate files or creating a mess.
Integrated SharePoint Links: All client SharePoint links are easily accessible  - no more searching for URLs.
Customizable On-Call Details: A dedicated window for on-call details for every client, fully customizable with an edit feature. You can also copy all on-call details with a single button.
Call-Out Tracker: View and fill the call-out tracker instantly with just a click.
Leads Work Management: Track report timings, mark completed tasks, and save work directly to an Excel file or take a quick snip for reference with just a button click.
Custom BTO Management: Dedicated buttons to update the BTO status for 3A and 3B teams for any custom date, with data saved directly to local storage.
Team members:
   Made an app that automatically opens all our ServiceNow client links, Citrix, Amazon Workspaces (HY1 VDI), Outlook, Notepad, and the necessary files and folders with just a single click.

Also discovered an extension that helped team members to quickly enter work notes directly in service now with the help of short cuts

Cloud concepts:
Learned the concepts of cloud networking ( vpcs, subnets , load balancers, routetables)
I have deployed virtual machines in the subnets and also configured internet gateway to access the internet and also configured NAT gateway in the public subnet in order to allow private subnet securely download pacakges and communicate with the external world

I have learned about vpc endpoint gateway to access private instances with adding IAM role to the private instance to access the S3 bucket without security credentials openly which is a risk and by using vpc endpoint  I was able to acess the S3 bucket without using NAT gateway which reduces the cloud cost and optimizes the computing resources

I have also learned about Application load balancer and done hands on it  --  Created two subnets with the target groups and deployed application in both the instances and configured the application load balancer to balance the load on both the instances to maintain zero downtime experience.

I have also learned of AWS WAF service firewall - I have created vpc with public subnet and internet gateway and deployed application in it and configured the WAF firewall along with the load balancer and have set the allow and deny rules in firewall to block and grant access to appropriate source to the application and applied restricted rules that not required to access the application.
